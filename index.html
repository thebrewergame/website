        <p>It's great to meet you. From a young age, I've always had a passion for technology, writing, the outdoors, and public speaking. Some around me have said I'd make a great lawyer, but I've been more interested in the hospitality industry from traveling the country with my family when I was younger. I aim to join the next generation of receptionists, and one day, I might just be the one greeting you from opposite the front desk. Outside that, I spend a grand amount of time on the world's stage of social media, write about what interests me in my The Writings of Matthew Brewer, and occasionally dabble into various other interests of mine, from photography to announcements work and web development.</p>
